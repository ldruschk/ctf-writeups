# City RSA (worth 300+257 points)
Part of the P.W.N. University CTF 2018 (https://uni.hctf.fun/pages/home/)

```
I know that frank that a**hole ate the last cookie, but no one believes me.

He wrote himself a service to sign messages, I found part of the source.

It runs here:

nc rsa.uni.hctf.fun 4422

Can you get me the message "YES, I did eat the last cookie" signed by his service?

I added a verifier for you using his public key:

nc checker.uni.hctf.fun 31337
[...]
```

The description included a download link for the source of the service, which, judging by the methods signatures, uses Textbook-RSA without any padding and is implemented using the chinese remainder theorem (CRT). The service also has a check which ensures `"594553"` is not part of the hex representation of the message to be signed, so we cannot sign the string directly. We also had access to the python script used for the checker, obviously excluding the flag.

Textbook-RSA means the service uses no padding, so for each message `m` the signature `sig(m)` can be calculated as `sig(m) = m^d mod N` where `d` is the private exponent and `N` is the public modulo.

The relevant parts of the signing service are:
```
int main(int argc, const char** argv) {
    city_rsa_config cfg;
    /* RSA parameters */
    char p_str[1024];
    char p_inv_str[1024];
    char q_str[1024];
    char d_str[1024];
    char e_str[1024];
    char d_q_str[1024];
    char d_p_str[1024];
    char input[32];
    char input_hex[67];
    char result[1024];
    int i;

    // [...] config is loaded here

    printf("Enter message:");
    fflush(stdout);
    fgets(input, sizeof(input_hex) / 2, stdin);


    input_hex[0] = '0';
    input_hex[1] = 'x';
    for(i = 0; i <= strlen(input); i++){
        sprintf(input_hex + 2 + i*2, "%02X", input[i]);
    }

    puts(input_hex);

    if (strstr(input_hex, "594553") != NULL) {
        // Security measure, don't agree to anything
        return 1;
    }

    /* Sign via RSA */
    city_rsa_init(&cfg, p_str, q_str, p_inv_str, d_str, e_str, d_p_str, d_q_str);
    //city_print_config(&cfg);
    city_rsa_sign(&cfg, result, input_hex);
    printf("The signature of your message is: 0x%s\n", result);

    return 0;
}
```

## Blinding attack
Since no padding is used, for three messages `x, y, z` where `x*y == z` it holds that `sig(x) * sig(y) == sig(z)` since `x^d * y^d == (x*y)^d == z^d`. Although we cannot sign the string directly, we can simply find some factors of the string and let the service sign these separately.

However, `fgets` will convert all non-ASCII characters to `0xff`, so the input cannot contain any bytes between `0x80` and `0xfe`. It is possible to find such factors and other teams have done this (there is also a writeup available explaining this approach), but we did not pursue this idea further.

## Buffer Overflow
The alternative solution, which we came across by accident, is caused by a buffer overflow when reading the string with `fgets`. We tried to get the service to sign `0x0`, but to do this we had to input the `0x00`-byte 33 times, otherwise the service would continue reading input. When we did this, we got the following signature back:
`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`
This was unexpected, since `0^d (mod N) == 0` should always hold, even when using the CRT.

What happened is that we overwrote `d_p_str`, since the `fgets` call reads 33 bytes including the terminating `0x00`, which in turn leads to `d_p_str` being read as `0x00`.

### Chinese Remainder Theorem
As mentioned before, the service uses the chinese remainder theorem to make the signature calculation more efficient. Instead of calculating `sig(m) = m^d mod N`, it does the following instead (according to Wikipedia):

Calculate `d_p = d mod (p-1)`, `d_q = d mod (q-1)` and `q_inv = q^(-1) mod p` s.t. `q_inv * q (mod p) == 1`. The first two are trivial, the latter one uses the extended euclidian algorithm.

Then the signature `m` can be calculated with `m_1 = m^(d_p) mod p` and `m_2 = m^(d_q) mod q` and finally `sig(m) = (q_inv * (m_1 - m_2) mod p) * q + m_2`.

### Solution
Note that the `d_p` and `d_q` are switched in the implementation and Wikipedia, so while we overwrote `d_p_str`, what really happened is that we set `d_q = 0` and our `m = 0`. Thus:
```
m_1 = m^(d_p) = 0^(d_p) = 0
m_2 = m^(d_q) = 0^0 = 1
s = (q_inv * (m_1 - m_2) mod p) * q + m_2 = (q_inv * (0 - 1) mod p) * q + 1
```
Since `q_inv * q == 1 (mod p)`, we know that `((-1 * q_inv) mod p) * q == -1 (mod p)` and, with the final `1` added, this is `s == 0 (mod p)`. What does this mean? Well, since `x mod p == 0` means that `x` is a multiple of `p` s.t. `x = k*p` for some natural `k`, we can find `p` by calculating `gcd(s,N) == p`. This allows us to recover `q = N/p` and thus we have solved the RSA factoring problem for this `N == p*q`, giving us access to the private key and allowing us to sign the message ourselves.

When sending the signature to the checker we obtain the flag `flag{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpMBETNC-44#C0ngr4tz}`. As mentioned before we actually discovered this overflow by accident (and even afterwards overlooked it), so at this point I would like to thank the organizers for pointing out that we actually triggered one of the intended solutions whereas we assumed there was a bug in their implementation (which was not released for the challenge) when signing 0 :-) (Although this technically is a bug, but an intentional one).

The final solution code is:
```
from math import gcd
# a is the signature obtained from the service
a = 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
